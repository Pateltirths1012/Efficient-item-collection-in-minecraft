# Efficient-item-collection-in-Minecraft

We compare DQN and PPO approaches for the task of collecting wood logs in Minecraft, a challenging 3D environment with complex visual inputs and sparse rewards. This project analyzes the performance characteristics, sample efficiency, and training stability of these two popular reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- MineRL environment
- OpenCV for observation processing
- NumPy, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization
