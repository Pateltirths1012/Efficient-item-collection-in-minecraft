# Efficient-item-collection-in-Minecraft

We have implemented and compared DQN and PPO algorithms for collecting wood logs in Minecraft. This project analyzes the performance characteristics, sample efficiency, and training stability of these two popular reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- MineRL environment
- OpenCV for observation processing
- NumPy, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization
